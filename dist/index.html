I didnâ€™t quite meet that goal before I moved (for a job) but I ended up taking 100s of photographs.</p><p>The photos subject matter range from beautiful homes to buildings that were in the process of being demolished or in extreme decay. The neighborhoods range from healthy to others that are hurting and need attention.</p><p>Overall, I found that St. Louis has a rich architectural histroy and a beauty that is unique, facsinating, and is rapidly changing.</p><a href="#neighborIndex" class="primary-btn">Start Exploring</a></div></div></section><main><section class="neighbor-rep"><div class="container"><h2 id="neighborIndex">Neighborhoods Represented</h2><ul class="neighborhood-list"></ul></div></section></main><footer><div class="container"><span>&copy; Rebecca Eilering</span> <a href="">Instagram link</a></div></footer><script src="js/main.js"></script></body></html>
